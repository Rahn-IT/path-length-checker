# Path Length Checker

This is a very crude application to scan a directory recursively and list all paths which are longer than a certain limit.

We periodically run into problems with windows file shares that create paths which are longer than the default limit of 260 characters.
To find all of those instances you can use this program to create a csv file.

# Usage

Precompiled exe file coming soon!

Just open the program, select a folder and click on "Scan".
